<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Madolino Zeferino Manuel is my full name, and I was born in kwanza-sul at sumbe, a teeny province in Angola.
   My mamaâ€™s name is Madalena Cambimbi and my father name is Domingos Jacinto Manuel, 
   I have 21 siblings and so fur 8 nephews. 
   It all started when I was brought to the Angolan capital city with months of life</p>

<p> I grew up in the capital city on a township called Caop B, with my step-mother, my father and my siblings.
  The township where we leave violence is the main police draw (attraction), 
  but with God's help I was able to avoid crimes and other negative deeds.</p>

<p>I completed high school in Angola 2022 before deciding to enrol in the prestigious university in my home nation. 
  In order to be evaluated, I had to take an admissions test. It required from me hard work to prepare myself. 
  It had required from me a lot of attention and to work extremely hard.</p>
<p>In consequence, I started putting extra work on myself,
  sleeping later than everyone else at home and waking up earlier than everyone else. 
  I only wanted to show myself that I could, but I started liking the process and the idea of being productive and learning.</p>
  <p>On the day of the exam, I was very calm, and I tried my best to not be distraught and panic, and I succeeded, thanks to God. 
    I got a very good mark that allowed me to pass and start studying.</p>
  <p>When university began, it did not take long for it to stop.
     Because of COVID, in March 2022, I was stopped from going to university,
      so my father found a way to send me to South Africa and study English, so I went, and I ended up studying at LAL, one of the most expensive and great language schools in the Western Cape south Africa. 
      I had the chance to meet many people from a lot of parts of the world, and some became friends, such friends that some I have as a family.</p>
  <p>In the same year, I applied to some of South Africa's best universities in Cape Town, 
    but I did not succumb because of their level of obligation. Despite this situation, 
    I was not sad, and so I applied to one of their collage programs at Eduvos, where I started developing my programming language (Python), 
    After a year, I got accepted to South Africa's best university of technology, 
    and I ended up doing a Bachelor in Electrical Engineering in 2023...</p>
